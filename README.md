# JavaScript-_Form_Validation
**Many websites utilize form validation for client-side validation of user details, card details, address details, and other information.

**If a mandatory input field name exists, the user can type a number, leave the field blank, type only one letter, and so on.

**All of these validations are simple to implement using JavaScript.
